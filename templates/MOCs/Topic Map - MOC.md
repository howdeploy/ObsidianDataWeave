# Topic Map: Personal Knowledge Management — MOC

A Map of Content (MOC) is a navigation hub — a note whose job is to collect links to related atomic notes, not to hold content itself. This MOC covers the core concepts and methodology of PKM as implemented in ObsidianDataWeave.

## Core Concepts

- [[Atomic Note Example]] — One idea per note; the foundational unit of a Zettelkasten
- [[Semantic Search with Smart Connections]] — Vector embeddings find related notes without manual tagging
- [[MOC as Navigation Hub]] — How MOCs provide flexible, non-hierarchical structure
- [[Tag Taxonomy Design]] — Domain/subtag conventions for universal, language-neutral classification

## Methodology

- [[Zettelkasten Slip-box Origins]] — Niklas Luhmann's card index system and why it works at scale
- [[Two-Level Hierarchy: MOC and Atomic Notes]] — Why ObsidianDataWeave uses exactly two levels (no sub-MOCs)
- [[Wikilink as Semantic Assertion]] — A link between notes is a claim about conceptual relationship
- [[Source Document as Unit of Work]] — One .docx → one MOC + N atomic notes per ObsidianDataWeave pipeline

*This MOC was auto-generated from `Example Document.docx`. MOC files in your vault are overwritten on each pipeline run — do not add manual content here. Use atomic notes for permanent knowledge.*
